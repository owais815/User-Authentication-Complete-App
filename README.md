### User Authentication Complete App
This repository contains the code for a fully functional authentication system built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This project was developed to learn and implement key concepts of authentication in a MERN stack application.

This project demonstrates how to create a complete login and signup system using the MERN stack. It covers backend and frontend development, connecting them through RESTful APIs, and deploying the application to a cloud platform.


## Features
User authentication with login and signup functionality
Password hashing for secure password storage
JSON Web Token (JWT) based user sessions
Responsive user interface built with React
Error handling and form validation
## Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data
Express.js: Web framework for building the backend API
React.js: Frontend library for building the user interface
Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server
bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords
jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JWTs
